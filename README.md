# About the repository

Here, I cloned the Twitter login page and added a toogle switch for dark mode.


### Installation

For installation, clone the repository and run the index.html to start the server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ozgur-okt/Twitter-Login-Screen-with-Dark-Mode-Toggle

```
### How it seems:
For the reason of its gif structure, colors seem a little blured and low-resolution in dark mode.
