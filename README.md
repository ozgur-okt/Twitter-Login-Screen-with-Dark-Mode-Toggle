# About the repository

Here, I cloned the Twitter login page and added a toogle switch for dark mode.


### Installation

For installation, clone the repository and run the index.html to start the server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ozgur-okt/twitter-login-screen-with-dark-mode-toggle

```
### How it seems:
P.S.: For the reason of representation's gif structure below, colors seem a little blured and low-resolution in dark mode.
